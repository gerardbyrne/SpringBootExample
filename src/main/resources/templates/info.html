		   <p>Section content for HTML5. 
				HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting 
				content for the World Wide Web and a core technology of the 
				Internet. It is the fifth revision of the HTML standard (created 
				in 1990 and standardized as HTML 4 as of 1997)[2] and, as of 
				December 2012, is a candidate recommendation of the World Wide 
				Web Consortium (W3C).[3] Its core aims have been to improve the 
				language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it 
				easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers 
				and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.). HTML5 is intended to 
				subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>

		   <p>Section content for CSS3. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet 
			  language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written 
			  in a markup language. While most often used to style web pages and 
			  interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any 
			  kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.</p>
